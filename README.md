2. This is my second project and while it was difficult at first, I really got the hang of PHP and all the debugging techniques associated with it. There is definitely room for improvement and I hope I can get some great feedback in this regards. But, with pleasure, I present to you my Project 2!
3. None really, I commented out some of my debugging code at the top. For my variables, I guess PHP does not like the way I am inputting and associating those values to my code.
4. No additional packages were used
